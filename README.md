# Math Tools: Linear Algebra Operations
Collection of functions and algorithms for performing various fundamental linear algebra operations, including determinant calculation, trace calculation, eigenvalues/eigenvectors calculation, LU decomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD). 
In this project, we provide implementations of key linear algebra operations using Python. Each operation is implemented as a separate function or module, allowing users to easily integrate the functionality into their own projects or explore the concepts in a hands-on manner.
#Implemented Operations
The following linear algebra operations are implemented in this project:
-Determinant calculation
-Trace calculation
-Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors calculation
-LU decomposition
-Singular value decomposition (SVD)
Each operation is illustrated with usage example.
